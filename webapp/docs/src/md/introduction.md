### Welcome to the Interstellar Alliance Social Experiment Step 3 [web app]({{URL_WEBAPP}})

<br>
The Interstellar Alliance Social Experiment Group is a grass roots movement that urges officials to publicly disclose the reality about UFOs, UAPs, and extraterrestrial life within one year, emphasizing that these phenomena pose no threat to humanity. We call for transparency and public education, stating that we will only support leaders who actively promote full disclosure.

This web application empowers individuals and organizations to efficiently send advocacy emails to relevant decision-makers, researchers, and leaders. Its primary purpose is to streamline civic engagement by providing curated contact lists tailored to the user's country or institution, ensuring that messages reach the appropriate recipients.

Key features include:

- Curated contact lists based on your country or institution
- Easy-to-use interface for sending emails and participating the campaign
- Export/import functionality for managing your sending history across devices

The platform emphasizes responsible communication and ease of use, making it simple for users to participate in the campaign, track their sending history, and manage their activity securely.
