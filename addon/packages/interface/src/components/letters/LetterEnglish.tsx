                        Despite military, scientific, and political statements to the contrary, we believe that UFOs or
                        UAPs do not represent a threat of any kind to national or global security or humanity at large.

                    <span>
                        There is overwhelming and well-researched evidence and thousands of eyewitness accounts that
                        these objects have been present throughout Earth's history without detrimental effect on the
                        day-to-day affairs of humanity.

                        Without supporting or promoting any related conspiracy theories, we believe that certain
                        organizations are withholding knowledge of this phenomenon out of an irrational fear and for
                        self- serving reasons. It's time for the secrets to end and a program of transparent public
                        education to begin in service to humanity.
